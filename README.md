# Diamond Price Regression

While kings and queens of the past preferred emeralds, sapphires and rubies, the modern stone of glamour is the diamond. They are valued for their perceived rarity, for their timelessness, and for the stories that can be told about them. At the diamond dealer, we are told to look for value in the Four C’s – carat, cut, color, and clarity.  To make sense of these features and how they affect the price of a diamond, we analyzed data from the world’s leading online diamond dealer, Blue Nile. Prices varying from $229 to over $2.3 million were best modeled using all features available in the data set using multiple linear regression. The final multiple regression model accounts for 98% of price variation, and has higher confidence for lower prices than the higher prices. Large, expensive diamonds, which are usually natural rather than lab-grown, may have extra price variation due to their immeasurable qualities like legacy, history, rarity, and glamour.
